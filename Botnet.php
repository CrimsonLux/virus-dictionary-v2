                <p>"Botnets are the source of all spam â€“ they're used for ID theft, extortion,
                    industrial espionage and finding other web pages to infect.
                    I would call it the Swiss Army Knife of the malware world. It does a lot
                    of things for a lot of people."
                    Like the majority of malware software, botnets are asymptomatic. 
                    Until you wake up and find your bank account has been drained, that is,
                    or discover that your ID has been appropriated for use by someone else. </p>
