                <p>
                 With scareware, a warning pops up on your computer screen telling
                 you that your computer is infected and attempts to sell you a
                 program to disinfect the program. This is the ultimate no-win situation.
                 If you click anywhere on the warning, you get infected.
                 If you ignore the warning, it will never go away.  And if you
                 fall for the ruse and buy the fake antivirus program, your computer
                 will then become another warrior in the scammer's botnet army. </p>
