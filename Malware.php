                <h2 class="section-heading">Malware Virus</h2>

                <p>The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices or to people.</p>
                <p>When you hear talk of viruses, Trojans, spyware and the like, what you're really hearing is talk of different kinds of malware.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">What does malware do?</h2>
                <p>The way malware goes about doing its damage can be helpful in categorizing what kind of malware you're dealing with. </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">How do you remove malware?</h2>
                <p>Each form of malware has its own way of infecting and damaging computers and data, and so each one requires a different malware removal method.
                   Avoiding suspicious emails, links or
                   websites are good online habits to have, but will only get you so far: attackers can sometimes compromise even legitimate websites.</p>
